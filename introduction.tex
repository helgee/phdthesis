The motion of an object in space is governed by non-linear equations.
Numerical analysis is therefore indispensable for the design of a spacecraft's trajectory.
Since the early days of spaceflight in the middle of the 20\textsuperscript{th} century software tools have been used to conduct the required numerical integrations and optimisations \todo{citation needed}.
The mission design and the design of the space system, which includes the space-based components as well as the ground-based components, are highly dependent on each other.
During the 
Commercial missions
Scientific space missions on the other hand are often extending the boundaries of what is technically feasible and are generally more complex than commercial missions.
Thus the mission design needs to take the unique properties and constraints of these missions into account.
