  title = {Julia and the Numerical Homogenization of {{PDEs}}},
  doi = {10.1109/HPTCDL.2014.8},
  abstract = {We discuss the advantages of using Julia for solving multiscale problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs). Multiscale problems are problems where the coefficients of a PDE oscillate rapidly on a microscopic length scale, but solutions are sought on a much larger, macroscopic domain. Solving multiscale problems requires both a theoretic result, i.e., a homogenization result yielding effective coefficients, as well as numerical solutions of the PDE at the microscopic and the macroscopic length scales. Numerical homogenization of PDEs with stochastic coefficients is especially computationally expensive. Under certain assumptions, effective coefficients can be found, but their calculation involves subtle numerical problems. The computational cost is huge due to the generally large number of stochastic dimensions. Multiscale problems arise in many applications, e.g., in uncertainty quantification, in the rational design of nanoscale sensors, and in the rational design of materials. Our code for the numerical stochastic homogenization of elliptic problems is implemented in Julia. Since multiscale problems pose new numerical problems, it is in any case necessary to develop new numerical codes. Julia is a dynamic language inspired by the Lisp family of languages, it is open-source, and it provides native-code compilation, access to highly optimized linear-algebra routines, support for parallel computing, and a powerful macro system. We describe our experience in using Julia and discuss the advantages of Julia's features in this problem domain.},

The algorithm computes each eigenvalue and all components of the corresponding eigenvector with high relative accuracy in O(n) operations. The algorithm is based on a shift-and-invert approach. Only a single element of the inverse of the shifted matrix eventually needs to be computed with double the working precision. Each eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector can be computed separately, which makes the algorithm adaptable for parallel computing. Our results extend to the complex Hermitian case. The algorithm is similar to the algorithm for solving the eigenvalue problem for real symmetric arrowhead matrices from N. Jakovčević Stor et al. (2015) [16].},

  title = {Bayesian Estimation of Discretely Observed Multi-Dimensional Diffusion Processes Using Guided Proposals},
  abstract = {Bayesian estimation of parameters of a diffusion based on discrete time observations poses a difficult problem due to the lack of a closed form expression for the likelihood. Data-augmentation has been proposed for obtaining draws from the posterior distribution of the parameters. Within this approach, the discrete time observations are augmented with diffusion bridges connecting these observations. This poses two challenges: (i) efficiently generating diffusion bridges; (ii) if unknown parameters appear in the diffusion coefficient, then direct implementation of data-augmentation results in an induced Markov chain which is reducible. In this paper we show how both challenges can be addressed in continuous time (before discretisation) by using guided proposals. These are Markov processes with dynamics described by the stochastic differential equation of the diffusion process with an additional term added to the drift coefficient to guide the process to hit the right end point of the bridge. The form of these proposals naturally provides a mapping that decouples the dependence between the diffusion coefficient and diffusion bridge using the driving Brownian motion of the proposals. As the guiding term has a singularity at the right end point, care is needed when discretisation is applied for implementation purposes. We show that this problem can be dealt with by appropriately time changing and scaling of the guided proposal process. In two examples we illustrate the performance of the algorithms we propose. The second of these concerns a diffusion approximation of a chemical reaction network with a four-dimensional diffusion driven by an eight-dimensional Brownian motion.},

  abstract = {The basic elements of model-based design for space missions have existed for almost a decade, awaiting an opportunity to implement them in the same place at the same time. In early design phases, combinations of models, concurrent engineering methods, and scenario-driven design have been used for several years with results that have exceeded even optimistic expectations; but the goal of extending these methods to later phases of design has been more elusive. JPL's model-based engineering design (MBED) initiative provides opportunity to reach that goal. It enables advanced systems engineering practice through a series of integrated, increasingly detailed models that provide continuity from architectural concept through detailed design. It extends current capability for rapid conceptual design, allowing thorough exploration of design tradespaces and selection of an optimal design point with associated cost and rationale; and it provides seamless connection to subsystem models and detailed design tool suites. We review the goals and status of MBED and show the expected interconnectivity between conceptual and detailed design.},

Using the principle of minimal sensitivity, we introduce an alternate expression for the mesh size for the Sinc collocation method which improves considerably the accuracy in computing eigenvalues for potentials with multiple wells. We apply our method to a number of potentials including potentials with multiple wells. The numerical results section clearly illustrates the high efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.

The method handles heterogeneous data sets, and leads to coherent schemes for compressing, denoising, and imputing missing entries across all data types simultaneously.

It consists of a 3D viewer and smart widgets, each providing a separate functionality to fulfill a specific engineering task. Smart widgets are aggregated in templates, which represent different engineering domains and lifecycle phases. The 3D engineering dashboard is implemented as an Android app, enabling the use of mobile devices. It is validated by an Industrie 4.0 manufacturing use case demonstrating its potential. With the 3D engineering dashboard time and cost can be reduced, while interoperability in heterogeneous system landscapes is improved.},

The conformal map is a polynomial adjustment to the sinh map, and allows the treatment of a finite number of singularities in the complex plane. In the case where locations are unknown, the so-called Sinc-Padé approximants are used to provide approximate results. This adaptive method is shown to have almost the same convergence properties. We use the conformal maps to generate high accuracy solutions to several challenging integrals, nonlinear waves, and multidimensional integrals.},

Two complementary approaches are identified: cyberizing the physical (CtP) means to endow physical subsystems with cyber-like abstractions and interfaces; and physicalizing the cyber (PtC) means to endow software and network components with abstractions and interfaces that represent their dynamics in time.},

Multi-Agent System (MAS) can help meeting these demands by enabling fast reconfigurations and smart fault handling and compensation. A previously developed MAS, distributed on real time and non-real time capable platforms, can increase these benefits by combining the advantages of both, real time and non-real time implementations of MAS when involved in controlling (a part of) a manufacturing plant. Even though different communication concepts have been developed and are provided within this MAS architecture, connections to other industrial IT systems such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) or third party MAS implementations have not been included. To enable maximizing the system's flexibility, a complete immersion of the MAS into the industrial IT environment needs to be provided. This paper proposes communication concepts, a running example and evaluation of the concepts for this problem.},

  title = {Julia: {{A Fresh Approach}} to {{Numerical Computing}}},
  abstract = {The Julia programming language is gaining enormous popularity. Julia was designed to be easy and fast. Most importantly, Julia shatters deeply established notions widely held in the applied community: 1. High-level, dynamic code has to be slow by some sort of law of nature. 2. It is sensible to prototype in one language and then recode in another language. 3. There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left untouched as they are built by the experts. Julia began with a deep understanding of the needs of the scientific programmer and the needs of the computer in mind. Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from computer science and computational science creating a new approach to scientific computing. This note introduces the programmer to the language and the underlying design theory. It invites the reader to rethink the fundamental foundations of numerical computing systems. In particular, there is the fascinating dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. We can pick just the right algorithm for the right circumstance and this can happen at runtime based on argument types (code selection via multiple dispatch). Abstraction recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away and ignored as irrelevant. The recognition of abstraction allows for code reuse (generic programming). A simple idea that yields incredible power. The Julia design facilitates this interplay in many explicit and subtle ways for machine performance and, most importantly, human convenience.},

  abstract = {Reliance on computationally expensive algorithms for inference has been limiting the use of Bayesian nonparametric models in large scale applications. To tackle this problem, we propose a Bayesian learning algorithm for DP mixture models. Instead of following the conventional paradigm – random initialization plus iterative update, we take an progressive approach. Starting with a given prior, our method recursively transforms it into an approximate posterior through sequential variational approximation. In this process, new components will be incorporated on the fly when needed. The algorithm can reliably estimate a DP mixture model in one pass, making it particularly suited for applications with massive data. Experiments on both synthetic data and real datasets demonstrate remarkable improvement on efficiency – orders of magnitude speed-up compared to the state-of-the-art.},

If the polynomial is real with only real distinct roots, the matrix can be chosen real. By using accurate forward stable algorithm for computing eigenvalues of real symmetric arrowhead matrices from (Jakovcevic Stor, Slapnicar, Barlow, 2015), we derive a forward stable algorithm for computation of roots of such polynomials in O(n2) operations. The algorithm computes each root to almost full accuracy. In some cases, the algorithm invokes extended precision routines, but only in the non-iterative part. Our examples include numerically difficult problems, like the well-known Wilkinson's polynomials. Our algorithm compares favourably to other method for polynomial root-finding, like MPSolve or Newton's method.},

The algorithm achieves O(nopt) complexity, where nopt is the number of degrees of freedom required to achieve a desired accuracy, which is determined adaptively. In addition, special tensor product equations, such as partial differential equations on rectangles, can be solved by truncating the operator in the y-direction with n\_y degrees of freedom and using a generalized Schur decomposition to upper triangularize, before applying the adaptive QR approach to the x-direction, requiring O(n\^2\_y n\^opt\_x) operations. The framework is implemented in the ApproxFun package written in the Julia programming language, which achieves highly competitive computational costs by exploiting unique features of Julia.},

This book attempts to fill this gap by addressing systems approach for STS design, highlighting the integrated design aspects, interactions between various subsystems and interdependencies. The main focus is towards the complex integrated design to arrive at an optimum, robust and cost effective space transportation system. The orbital mechanics of satellites including different coordinate frames, orbital perturbations and orbital transfers are explained. For launching the satellites to meet specific mission requirements, viz., payload/orbit, design considerations, giving step by step procedure are briefed. The selection methodology for launch vehicle configuration, its optimum staging and the factors which influence the vehicle performance are summarized. The influence of external, internal and dynamic operating environments experienced by the vehicle subsystems and the remedial measures needed are highlighted. The mission design strategies and their influence on the vehicle design process are elaborated. The various critical aspects of STS subsystems like flight mechanics, propulsion, structures and materials, thermal systems, stage auxiliary systems, navigation, guidance and control and the interdependencies and interactions between them are covered. The design guidelines, complexity of the flight environment and the reentry dynamics for the reentry missions are included. The book is not targeted as a design tool for any particular discipline or subsystem. Some of the design related equations or expressions are not attempted to derive from the first principle as this is beyond the scope of this book. However, the important analytical expressions, graphs and sketches which are essential to provide in-depth understanding for the design process as well as to understand the interactions between different subsystems are appropriately included.},

  abstract = {This master's thesis explores the possibility to provide access to the computing power of a GPU from the high-level programming language Julia. An important requirement here is to keep the programmer's productivity at the same high level as if he would use Julia without a GPU. Indeed, very specialized and detailed technical knowledge is needed in order to program a GPU, making it complex and time-consuming. In many modern scientific domains quite a lot of brute computing power is required, but often these domains lack the technical expertise to use GPUs in an efficient manner. The purpose of this thesis is to provide access to a GPU from Julia in a way that shields the GPU details from the programmer. In a first step we define and implement in Julia abstractions that can be executed in parallel on the GPU. Next we adapt the Julia compiler such that it can translate these abstractions to GPU code. The resulting compiler infrastructure manages the GPU in a way that is transparent to the programmer. Finally we evaluate the abstractions and compiler infrastructure in the context of a concrete application, namely the trace transform.},

  abstract = {Distributed Space Missions  are gaining momentum in their application to earth observation missions owing to their unique ability to increase observation sampling in multiple dimensions. DSM design is a complex problem with many design variables, multiple objectives determining performance and cost and emergent, often unexpected, behaviors. There are very few open-access tools available to explore the tradespace of variables, minimize cost and maximize performance for pre-defined science goals, and therefore select the most optimal design. This paper presents a software tool that can multiple DSM architectures based on pre-defined design variable ranges and size those architectures in terms of predefined science and cost metrics. The tool will help a user select Pareto optimal DSM designs based on design of experiments techniques. The tool will be applied to some earth observation examples to demonstrate its applicability in making some key decisions between different performance metrics and cost metrics early in the design lifecycle.},

  abstract = {More than 20 years of research has created a large body of ideas, concepts, and theories for model-based development of embedded software-intensive systems. These approaches have been implemented by several tools and successfully applied to various development projects. However, the everyday use of model-based approaches in the automotive and avionic industries is still limited. Most of the time, the engineers work with a predefined set of isolated tools, and therefore adapt their engineering methods and process to the available tools. Today, the industry achieves tool integration by demand-driven, pragmatic, and ad-hoc composed chains of a priori existent commercial tools. Nevertheless, these tool chains are not (and cannot be) seamless, since the integration that can be achieved is not deep enough. This hampers the reuse and refinement of models, which subsequently leads to problems like redundancy, inconsistency, and lack of automation. In the end, these deficiencies decrease both the productivity and quality that could be provided by model-based approaches. To overcome these problems, a deep, coherent, and comprehensive integration of models and tools is required. Such an integration can be achieved by the following three ingredients: 1) a comprehensive modeling theory that serves as a semantic domain for the models, 2) an integrated architectural model that holistically describes the product and process, and 3) a manner to build tools that conform to the modeling theory and allow the authoring of the product model. We show that from a scientific point of view, all ingredients are at our hands to do a substantial step into an integrated process and tool world. Further, we illustrate why such a solution has not been achieved so far, and discuss what is to be done to get a step closer to seamless model-based engineering.},

  doi = {10.1145/2627373.2627383},
  abstract = {Arrays are such a rich and fundamental data type that they tend to be built into a language, either in the compiler or in a large low-level library. Defining this functionality at the user level instead provides greater flexibility for application domains not envisioned by the language designer. Only a few languages, such as C++ and Haskell, provide the necessary power to define n-dimensional arrays, but these systems rely on compile-time abstraction, sacrificing some flexibility. In contrast, dynamic languages make it straightforward for the user to define any behavior they might want, but at the possible expense of performance. As part of the Julia language project, we have developed an approach that yields a novel trade-off between flexibility and compile-time analysis. The core abstraction we use is multiple dispatch. We have come to believe that while multiple dispatch has not been especially popular in most kinds of programming, technical computing is its killer application. By expressing key functions such as array indexing using multi-method signatures, a surprising range of behaviors can be obtained, in a way that is both relatively easy to write and amenable to compiler analysis. The compact factoring of concerns provided by these methods makes it easier for user-defined types to behave consistently with types in the standard library.},

  abstract = {A spectral method for solving linear partial differential equations (PDEs) with variable coefficients and general boundary conditions defined on rectangular domains is described, based on separable representations of partial differential operators and the one-dimensional ultraspherical spectral method. If a partial differential operator is of splitting rank 2, such as the operator associated with Poisson or Helmholtz, the corresponding PDE is solved via a generalized Sylvester matrix equation, and a bivariate polynomial approximation of the solution of degree (n\_x,n\_y) is computed in O(n\_x n\_y)\^3/2 operations. Partial differential operators of splitting rank $>$=3 are solved via a linear system involving a block-banded matrix in O(min(n\_x\^3 n\_y,n\_x n\_y\^3)) operations. Numerical examples demonstrate the applicability of our 2D spectral method to a broad class of PDEs, which includes elliptic and dispersive time-evolution equations. The resulting PDE solver is written in $\backslash$sc Matlab and is publicly available as part of $\backslash$sc Chebfun. It can resolve solutions requiring over a million degrees of freedom in under 60 seconds. An experimental implementation in the Julia language can currently perform the same solve in 10 seconds.},

  title = {{{CauseMap}}: {{Fast}} Inference of Causality from Complex Time Series},
  doi = {10.7287/peerj.preprints.583v2},
  abstract = {Background: Establishing health-related causal relationships is a central pursuit in biomedical research. Yet, the interdependent non-linearity of biological systems renders causal dynamics laborious and at times impractical to disentangle. This pursuit is further impeded by the dearth of time series that are sufficiently long to observe and understand recurrent patterns of flux. However, as data generation costs plummet and technologies like wearable devices democratize data collection, we anticipate a coming surge in the availability of biomedically-relevant time series data. Given the life-saving potential of these burgeoning resources, it is critical to invest in the development of open source software tools that are capable of drawing meaningful insight from vast amounts of time series data. Results: Here we present CauseMap, the first open source implementation of convergent cross mapping (CCM), a method for establishing causality from long time series data ($>$ 25 observations). Compared to existing time series methods, CCM has the advantage of being model-free and robust to unmeasured confounding that could otherwise induce spurious associations. CCM builds on Takens’ Theorem, a well-established result from dynamical systems theory that requires only mild assumptions. This theorem allows us to reconstruct high dimensional system dynamics using a time series of only a single variable. These reconstructions can be thought of as shadows of the true causal system. If the reconstructed shadows can predict points from the opposing time series, we can infer that the corresponding variables are providing views of the same causal system, and so are causally related. Unlike traditional metrics, this test can establish the directionality of causation, even in the presence of feedback loops. Furthermore, since CCM can extract causal relationships from times series of, e.g. a single individual, it may be a valuable tool to personalized medicine. We implement CCM in Julia, a high-performance programming language designed for facile technical computing. Our software package, CauseMap, is platform-independent and freely available as an official Julia package. Conclusions: CauseMap is an efficient implementation of a state-of-the-art algorithm for detecting causality from time series data. We believe this tool will be a valuable resource for biomedical research and personalized medicine.},

  abstract = {Matrix Depot is a Julia software package that provides easy access to a large and diverse collection of test matrices. Its novelty is threefold. First, it is extensible by the user, and so can be adapted to include the user’s own test problems. In doing so it facilitates experimentation and makes it easier to carry out reproducible research. Second, it amalgamates in a single framework three different types of matrix collections, comprising parametrized test matrices, regularization test problems, and real-life sparse matrix data. Third, it fully exploits the Julia language. It uses multiple dispatch to help provide a simple interface and, in particular, to allow matrices to be generated in any of the numeric data types supported by the language.},

  abstract = {There has been an explosion in the amount of digital text information available in recent years, leading to challenges of scale for traditional inference algorithms for topic models. Recent advances in stochastic variational inference algorithms for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) have made it feasible to learn topic models on very large-scale corpora, but these methods do not currently take full advantage of the collapsed representation of the model. We propose a stochastic algorithm for collapsed variational Bayesian inference for LDA, which is simpler and more efficient than the state of the art method. In experiments on large-scale text corpora, the algorithm was found to converge faster and often to a better solution than previous methods. Human-subject experiments also demonstrated that the method can learn coherent topics in seconds on small corpora, facilitating the use of topic models in interactive document analysis software.},

  abstract = {In order to meet the future vision of robotic missions, engineers will face intricate mission concepts, new operational approaches, and technologies that have yet to be developed. The concept of smaller, model driven projects helps this transition by including life-cycle cost as part of the decision making process. For example, since planetary exploration missions have cost ceilings and short development periods, heritage flight hardware is utilized. However, conceptual designs that rely solely on heritage technology will result in estimates that may not be truly representative of the actual mission being designed and built. The Laboratory for Spacecraft and Mission Design (LSMD) at the California Institute of Technology is developing integrated concurrent models for mass and cost estimations. The purpose of this project is to quantify the infusion of specific technologies where the data would be useful in guiding technology developments leading up to a mission. This paper introduces the design-to-cost model to determine the implications of various technologies on the spacecraft system in a collaborative engineering environment. In addition, comparisons of the benefits of new or advanced technologies for future deep space missions are examined},

The algorithm is based on Newton's method with carefully selected initial guesses for the nodes and a fast evaluation scheme for the associated orthogonal polynomial. In the Gauss-Hermite case the initial guesses and evaluation scheme rely on explicit asymptotic formulas. For generalized Gauss-Hermite, the initial guesses are furnished by sampling a certain equilibrium measure and the associated polynomial evaluated via a Riemann-Hilbert reformulation. In both cases the n-point quadrature rule is computed in O(n) operations to an accuracy that is close to machine precision. For sufficiently large n, some of the quadrature weights have a value less than the smallest positive normalized floating-point number in double precision and we exploit this fact to achieve a complexity as low as O(sqrt(n))).},

The algorithm computes all eigenvalues and all components of the corresponding eigenvectors with high relative accuracy in O(n\^2) operations under certain circumstances. The algorithm is based on a shift-and-invert approach. Only a single element of the inverse of the shifted matrix eventually needs to be computed with double the working precision. Each eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector can be computed separately, which makes the algorithm adaptable for parallel computing. Our results extend to Hermitian arrowhead matrices, real symmetric diagonal-plus-rank-one matrices and singular value decomposition of real triangular arrowhead matrices.},

We propose an annealed importance sampling procedure for estimating expectations with respect to the posterior. The proposed algorithm is useful in cases where finding a good proposal density is challenging, and when estimates of the marginal likelihood are required. The effect of likelihood estimation is investigated, and the results provide guidelines on how to set up the precision of the likelihood estimation in order to optimally implement the procedure. The methodological results are empirically demonstrated in several simulated and real data examples.},

  abstract = {In the course of evolution, proteins show a remarkable conservation of their three-dimensional structure and their biological function, leading to strong evolutionary constraints on the sequence variability between homologous proteins. Our method aims at extracting such constraints from rapidly accumulating sequence data, and thereby at inferring protein structure and function from sequence information alone. Recently, global statistical inference methods (e.g. direct-coupling analysis, sparse inverse covariance estimation) have achieved a breakthrough towards this aim, and their predictions have been successfully implemented into tertiary and quaternary protein structure prediction methods. However, due to the discrete nature of the underlying variable (amino-acids), exact inference requires exponential time in the protein length, and efficient approximations are needed for practical applicability. Here we propose a very efficient multivariate Gaussian modeling approach as a variant of direct-coupling analysis: the discrete amino-acid variables are replaced by continuous Gaussian random variables. The resulting statistical inference problem is efficiently and exactly solvable. We show that the quality of inference is comparable or superior to the one achieved by mean-field approximations to inference with discrete variables, as done by direct-coupling analysis. This is true for (i) the prediction of residue-residue contacts in proteins, and (ii) the identification of protein-protein interaction partner in bacterial signal transduction. An implementation of our multivariate Gaussian approach is available at the website $<$a href="http://areeweb.polito.it/ricerca/cmp/node/521"$>$http://areeweb.polito.it/ricerca/cmp/code$<$/a$>$.},
